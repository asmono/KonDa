# Hello and Thank You,
# Here is something you need to know about the KonDa Software.

The KonDa software is made for increase time eficiency, Arrival data usage, and optimize the on going research. Arrival data is the earthquake data type which obtained from BMKG and ISC institution and also another geology and/or geophysics institution. The KonDa software converting the data format institution to be LOTOS (Local Tomography Software) data input format.

KonDa version released based on public user. I hope anyone able to use this KonDa software for their Seismic Tomography research instead changing the data format manually.

KonDa version is made and still developed by Dwi asmono (asmonodwi@outlook.com). Next update plan is Paradigm programming transformation (procedural to OOP (object oriented Programming)), Provide it's GUI (graphical user interface), and executable software.

# How to Use:
"KonDa for GitHub 1st release.ipynb" is based on Jupyeter-Notebook so you can run this program with no installation but Anaconda. The data input example for this program is "format data input_dataArrival_BMKG.txt" and "format data input_dataArrival_ISC.txt" both of them have different data format. After you run the program you will get rays.dat and sta.dat for LOTOS data input and log.dat for evalute the conversion result.

Dwi asmono is waiting for your information if you get trouble on using this KonDa Software or any information you thinking about this KonDa Software.
